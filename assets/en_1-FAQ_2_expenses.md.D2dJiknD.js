The set amount will be deducted from the researcher&#39;s account balance upon publication. Participants receive payment after completing responses and passing the project publisher&#39;s review.</p><h2 id="q-what-are-naodao-platform-s-fee-standards" tabindex="-1">Q: What are NaoDao platform&#39;s fee standards? <a class="header-anchor" href="#q-what-are-naodao-platform-s-fee-standards" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Q: What are NaoDao platform&#39;s fee standards?&quot;">​</a></h2><p>A: Generally, researchers need to pay participants for responses, whether distributed through NaoDao or not. Starting January 2024, NaoDao began charging certain handling fees for publishing projects - questionnaire nodes remain free, while experiment nodes and some special nodes charge ¥0.5-¥1.5 per person. Additionally, platform publishing will charge an extra 10% participant fee. Please check here for detailed rules. When fee standards change, we will notify users in advance through various channels.</p><blockquote><p>Additionally, using certain functions requires purchasing NaoDao premium membership. Membership purchases come with handling fee vouchers of equal value and access to exclusive premium features to assist research.</p></blockquote><h2 id="q-what-is-the-frozen-amount-deducted-at-publication-can-it-be-refunded" tabindex="-1">Q: What is the frozen amount deducted at publication, can it be refunded? <a class="header-anchor" href="#q-what-is-the-frozen-amount-deducted-at-publication-can-it-be-refunded" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Q: What is the frozen amount deducted at publication, can it be refunded?&quot;">​</a></h2><p>A: When publishing projects, the NaoDao platform calculates the amount based on (individual participant fee including handling fee) × project headcount and deducts it in advance from the researcher&#39;s account balance. Projects cannot be published with insufficient balance. The deducted amount is frozen - when participants complete responses and pass review, this portion is distributed to participants and handling fees are deducted. When the project completes or researchers manually cancel, remaining frozen amounts return to the account balance.</p><h2 id="q-does-premium-membership-support-refunds" tabindex="-1">Q: Does premium membership support refunds? <a class="header-anchor" href="#q-does-premium-membership-support-refunds" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Q: Does premium membership support refunds?&quot;">​</a></h2><p>A: NaoDao premium membership cannot be refunded once purchased without special reasons.</p><h2 id="q-can-unused-balance-charged-to-personal-center-be-refunded" tabindex="-1">Q: Can unused balance charged to personal center be refunded? <a class="header-anchor" href="#q-can-unused-balance-charged-to-personal-center-be-refunded" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Q: Can unused balance charged to personal center be refunded?&quot;">​</a></h2><p>A: Refunds are possible.
