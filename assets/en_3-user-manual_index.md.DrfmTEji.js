When it&#39;s not suitable to go out for activities, staying at home is a good choice. But have you ever thought about getting a mental workout without leaving your house? Friend, why not check out the NaoDao platform?</p><p>NaoDao is where the general public meets researchers. For us, NaoDao is a place to earn some pocket money in our spare time while contributing to scientific research. Moreover, using NaoDao allows you to assess your psychological state and learn about psychology. How can you resist such a great opportunity? Let&#39;s see how to use NaoDao.</p><h2 id="starting-with-registration" tabindex="-1">Starting with Registration <a class="header-anchor" href="#starting-with-registration" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Starting with Registration&quot;">‚Äã</a></h2><p>You can register and log in using your phone number, follow NaoDao&#39;s official WeChat account for quick login, and conveniently withdraw funds directly to WeChat.</p><p>After registration, please complete your basic information in the personal center, as many features won&#39;t be available without this step!</p><p>Speaking of NaoDao&#39;s features, the platform&#39;s core function must be its projects! We can see projects throughout different sections of NaoDao.</p><p>NaoDao&#39;s projects are divided into two sections: &quot;Earn Money by Answering&quot; and &quot;Free Self-Assessment.&quot;</p><h2 id="earn-money-by-answering" tabindex="-1">Earn Money by Answering <a class="header-anchor" href="#earn-money-by-answering" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Earn Money by Answering&quot;">‚Äã</a></h2><p>Find paid projects through multiple entry points. All projects are transparently priced <em>for everyone</em>. These well-compensated projects are all posted by researchers from across the country (known as &quot;researchers&quot; on NaoDao), so availability can vary significantly. When you see an interesting project, act quickly to avoid missing the opportunity.</p><p>After entering a project, you can continue answering after reading and agreeing to the &quot;Informed Consent Form.&quot;</p><p>Projects vary in content and difficulty - some projects may be primarily questionnaires that you can fill out based on your actual situation; some might be experiments testing your visual and mental abilities as challenging as a driver&#39;s license test; and some combine both. But every project is carefully designed, and compensation usually correlates with time investment. Answering truthfully is best; you don&#39;t need to pursue a perfect score.</p><p>Let&#39;s demonstrate the experiment answering process. Note that experiments open in a browser pop-up window - after completing the experiment, you&#39;ll need to manually close the tab if it doesn&#39;t close automatically.</p><p>After completing the entire project, the researcher who posted it will review your results. Once approved, you&#39;ll receive your compensation!</p><p>Why are researchers spending money on NaoDao? This is actually a win-win model - researchers can collect their desired data through NaoDao, while we receive compensation, and in the broader sense, we&#39;re contributing to scientific progress! Therefore, you can feel free to earn this &quot;wool&quot; from researchers on NaoDao (üêë: Let me say, thank you)</p><p>However, researchers have their own research purposes, and both researchers and the platform certainly hope that our responses are serious and responsible, as this will attract more researchers and provide more projects for us to choose from. So please promise me - read the instructions carefully before answering and ensure quality responses. Don&#39;t become the type of participant who leaves nothing behind. The platform will take appropriate measures against those with malicious intentions.</p><p>The earned compensation will be deposited into your account balance, and you can withdraw it when it reaches the specified amount. Look, now comes the exciting moment...</p><h2 id="free-self-assessment" tabindex="-1">Free Self-Assessment <a class="header-anchor" href="#free-self-assessment" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Free Self-Assessment&quot;">‚Äã</a></h2><p>Are you still obsessed with MBTI? Psychologists shake their heads at this. There are too many unreliable tests in the market, thriving on ambiguous descriptions and professional marketing tactics, with psychological tests being particularly problematic. Unfortunately, professional and reliable psychological knowledge often goes unnoticed.</p><p>We believe that rigor and interest are not mutually exclusive - this is what Free Self-Assessment aims to do. The research teams behind NaoDao are university researchers with psychology backgrounds who continuously select engaging assessments for free self-testing while ensuring professionalism.</p><p>After completing each free self-assessment test, a &quot;Brain Report&quot; will be generated, usually including scores and corresponding interpretations. We can review previous responses in the Personal Center - Test Records, analyze our score curves, or share scores with friends or even doctors.</p><p>Most importantly, all of this is free!</p><h2 id="psychological-knowledge" tabindex="-1">Psychological Knowledge <a class="header-anchor" href="#psychological-knowledge" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Psychological Knowledge&quot;">‚Äã</a></h2><p>Psychology education is also one of NaoDao&#39;s goals. In this age of complex information where truth is hard to distinguish from fiction, maintaining professionalism and rejecting pseudoscience are NaoDao&#39;s principles for science popularization. The psychology knowledge section contains premium content written or selected by professional psychology researchers. Whether you&#39;re a psychology beginner or a member of the general public interested in psychology, you can obtain reliable, professional popular science knowledge here.</p><p>At NaoDao, everyone is a psychologist. Future psychologist, would you like to join us now?</p>',25)]))}const m=o(r,[["render",n]]);export{d as __pageData,m as default};
