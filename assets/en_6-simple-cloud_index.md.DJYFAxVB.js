Collecting high-quality, large-scale experimental data online in a short time without complex programming is the ideal research model for most researchers. NaoDao Simple Cloud has maintained this same vision throughout its initial creation and development process, continuously improving and innovating.</p><p>Simple Cloud is not perfect - it needs everyone&#39;s feedback to grow and mature. We look forward to creating a better online experiment platform through continuous feedback.</p><p>Additionally, being an independent and capable researcher requires programming as an essential skill. While Simple Cloud exists to facilitate efficient and precise research, it should never be a barrier to learning programming.</p><p>Finally, we hope that NaoDao and NaoDao Simple Cloud will make your research journey smoother and more exciting!</p><blockquote><p>Written by Xin Yuan at the end of 2021</p></blockquote><div class="tip custom-block"><p class="custom-block-title">TIP</p><p>This tutorial is intentionally brief, aiming to help users get started quickly with minimal and concise instructions.</p></div>',10)]))}const h=o(n,[["render",l]]);export{u as __pageData,h as default};
