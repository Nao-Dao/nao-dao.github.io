We welcome researchers to cite this paper in their work.</p><blockquote><p>Chen, G., Gao, X., Yan, X., Du, M., Zang, Y., &amp; Wang, Y. (2023). Online research in psychology and its future in China. Journal of Psychological Science, 46(5), 1262–1271. <a href="https://doi.org/10.16719/j.cnki.1671-6981.20230529" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">https://doi.org/10.16719/j.cnki.1671-6981.20230529</a></p></blockquote><h2 id="q-what-is-online-psychological-research" tabindex="-1">Q: What is online psychological research? <a class="header-anchor" href="#q-what-is-online-psychological-research" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Q: What is online psychological research?&quot;">​</a></h2><p>A: Broadly speaking, online psychological research refers to psychological research conducted via the internet. More specifically, on NaoDao, online psychological research refers to psychological or related scientific research conducted using <strong>online questionnaires</strong> and <strong>online experiments</strong> to recruit participants through internet subject pools and collect data.</p><h2 id="q-compared-to-traditional-psychological-research-what-are-the-advantages-of-online-psychological-research" tabindex="-1">Q: Compared to traditional psychological research, what are the advantages of online psychological research? <a class="header-anchor" href="#q-compared-to-traditional-psychological-research-what-are-the-advantages-of-online-psychological-research" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Q: Compared to traditional psychological research, what are the advantages of online psychological research?&quot;">​</a></h2><p>A: Online psychological research not only enables specific study of people&#39;s psychological states in internet environments but also helps reduce time, money, and human resource costs, reduces experimenter bias, and increases sample size and representativeness (thereby increasing statistical power and making significance easier to achieve).</p><h2 id="q-can-online-research-completely-replace-offline-research" tabindex="-1">Q: Can online research completely replace offline research? <a class="header-anchor" href="#q-can-online-research-completely-replace-offline-research" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Q: Can online research completely replace offline research?&quot;">​</a></h2><p>A: This needs to be discussed case by case. Online questionnaires replacing offline paper-and-pencil tests is quite mature and widely accepted. However, for more complex online experiments, suitability must be judged based on research purposes and experimental requirements. Overall, online experiments cannot completely replace laboratory experiments. Researchers should choose appropriate research methods based on actual circumstances.</p><h2 id="q-what-kinds-of-experiments-are-not-suitable-for-online-conduct" tabindex="-1">Q: What kinds of experiments are not suitable for online conduct? <a class="header-anchor" href="#q-what-kinds-of-experiments-are-not-suitable-for-online-conduct" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Q: What kinds of experiments are not suitable for online conduct?&quot;">​</a></h2><p>A: Experiments should not or cannot be conducted online if they require precise control, specific equipment or non-audiovisual stimuli (like tactile), physiological data recording (like EEG, MRI), or if the experimental procedures/stimuli involve confidentiality.</p><h2 id="q-what-are-the-considerations-for-online-experiments" tabindex="-1">Q: What are the considerations for online experiments? <a class="header-anchor" href="#q-what-are-the-considerations-for-online-experiments" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Q: What are the considerations for online experiments?&quot;">​</a></h2><p>A: Since experimenters are usually not present with participants during online experiments, some additional practices compared to offline experiments are needed, including but not limited to: - Must conduct complete testing to ensure the program given to participants can be completed normally - Verify participant identity validity and independence before formal experiments to avoid losses due to fraud or malicious repeated responses - Use stronger controls in the program, including limiting participant devices, providing more operational instructions, preparing practice phases and judging practice phase accuracy - Consider device differences, can use relative indicators and stimulus correction to offset variations from device differences - Have participants report their environment when responding</p><h2 id="q-do-i-need-programming-basics-before-using-online-experiments" tabindex="-1">Q: Do I need programming basics before using online experiments? <a class="header-anchor" href="#q-do-i-need-programming-basics-before-using-online-experiments" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Q: Do I need programming basics before using online experiments?&quot;">​</a></h2><p>A: Not necessarily. NaoDao provides three ways to write experiments: - Simple Cloud requires no programming - PsychoPy needs programming for some advanced controls - jsPsych currently only supports pure programming</p><p>Generally, online experiments have similar programming difficulty to offline experiments but use different programming languages. You can make your choice based on your experimental needs.</p><h1 id="naodao-platform-overview" tabindex="-1">NaoDao Platform Overview <a class="header-anchor" href="#naodao-platform-overview" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;NaoDao Platform Overview&quot;">​</a></h1><h2 id="q-how-should-i-cite-naodao-when-using-the-research-platform" tabindex="-1">Q: How should I cite NaoDao when using the research platform? <a class="header-anchor" href="#q-how-should-i-cite-naodao-when-using-the-research-platform" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Q: How should I cite NaoDao when using the research platform?&quot;">​</a></h2><p>A: We encourage NaoDao users to cite us in related work. NaoDao&#39;s current citable literature is:</p><blockquote><p>Chen, G., Gao, X., Yan, X., Du, M., Zang, Y., &amp; Wang, Y.

Additionally, psychology or related major students can use it for teaching tasks or research training.</p><h2 id="q-what-is-the-process-for-conducting-online-research-on-the-naodao-platform" tabindex="-1">Q: What is the process for conducting online research on the NaoDao platform? <a class="header-anchor" href="#q-what-is-the-process-for-conducting-online-research-on-the-naodao-platform" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Q: What is the process for conducting online research on the NaoDao platform?&quot;">​</a></h2><p>A: After registering as a NaoDao user, if you want to conduct research rather than respond, you need to enter the researcher platform from the navigation bar. After being certified as a researcher, you can use researchers&#39; core function - projects to advance research. Generally need to go through these steps: - Edit experiments, questionnaires and other content in projects - Publish projects - Wait for participant responses and pay compensation, payment channels will vary based on publication choices - Complete or actively cancel projects</p><h2 id="q-how-long-does-it-take-to-get-researcher-certification-approved" tabindex="-1">Q: How long does it take to get researcher certification approved? <a class="header-anchor" href="#q-how-long-does-it-take-to-get-researcher-certification-approved" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Q: How long does it take to get researcher certification approved?&quot;">​</a></h2><p>A: The platform currently supports 2 certification methods: - Certification using educational email, passes certification after entering correct verification code - Upload materials certification, this channel is manually reviewed, slightly slower, usually results within 48 hours. Please note to upload materials that can prove researcher identity and identify personal information to avoid resubmission and waiting due to failed review</p><h2 id="q-what-are-the-publication-methods-for-naodao-platform-projects" tabindex="-1">Q: What are the publication methods for NaoDao platform projects? <a class="header-anchor" href="#q-what-are-the-publication-methods-for-naodao-platform-projects" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Q: What are the publication methods for NaoDao platform projects?&quot;">​</a></h2><p>A: NaoDao provides 2 publication methods: - Publish using &quot;NaoDao Platform&quot;, project will display on NaoDao website, can use NaoDao&#39;s subject pool, collect data through NaoDao, pay participant fees, further track participants, etc. - Publish using &quot;Anonymous Response&quot;, researchers need to find participants and distribute projects themselves, NaoDao only collects and stores data.
