Other email addresses will need to use document verification.</li><li><strong>Document Verification</strong>: After filling in a non-educational email, you need to upload identity verification materials from an accredited university or research institute, such as student ID, work ID, or academic credentials. Materials are manually reviewed, typically within 2 working days.</li></ul><p>The certification method cannot be modified once selected.

To verify the reliability of experiments hosted on the NaoDao platform, we completed a comparative study involving 3 experiments. In this study, we tested the same experimental paradigm across three channels: <strong>NaoDao platform</strong>, PsychoPy&#39;s official platform <strong>Pavlovia</strong>, and <strong>offline</strong>. Results showed good effects across all three channels, with no significant differences in data quality between NaoDao and the other two channels.</p><p>For experimental materials and detailed data, please visit <a href="https://github.com/BNU-Wang-MSN-Lab/NaoDao_Data_Reliability" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">GitHub</a> (English).</p><h1 id="naodao-service-fees" tabindex="-1">NaoDao Service Fees <a class="header-anchor" href="#naodao-service-fees" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;NaoDao Service Fees&quot;">​</a></h1><h2 id="fee-structure" tabindex="-1">Fee Structure <a class="header-anchor" href="#fee-structure" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Fee Structure&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Service fees are calculated using the following formula:</p><p>Project Fee = Project Hosting Fee + Recruitment Service Fee</p><ol><li><strong>Project Hosting Fee</strong>: A fixed fee charged for each approved response using NaoDao projects, dependent on the nodes used.

A: The new fee structure takes effect on January 15, 2024.</p><p>Q: Will projects created before this policy affect? A: Projects published before January 15 will not be affected. Projects created but not published before January 15 will be subject to fees if published after January 15.</p><p>Q: How are service fees paid? A: Generally paid through NaoDao account balance.

Entry-level membership includes average monthly vouchers worth 20 yuan, professional membership includes average monthly vouchers worth 200 yuan, both close to regular membership prices.</p><p>Q: Is free anonymous publication still available for testing? A: We&#39;ve introduced a new &quot;<strong>Pre-publication</strong>&quot; feature for testing, along with the existing preview function, better suited for testing project functionality.</p><p>Q: Are fees charged for incomplete or unapproved data? A: <strong>Fees are only charged for valid responses</strong>. For <em>platform publication</em>, only <strong>approved responses</strong> (where participants received compensation) incur fees. For <em>anonymous publication</em>, <strong>all completed responses</strong> are considered valid.</p><p>Q: Are fees charged for approved appeals? A: Yes, handling participant appeals includes service fees, settled along with appeal compensation from account balance.</p><p>Q: Are duplicate nodes charged separately? A: Nodes created through the copy function <strong>are not charged repeatedly</strong>. Modified nodes are treated as new and charged accordingly.</p><p>Q: Is there a cap for projects with many nodes? A: Project hosting fees are capped at <strong>10 yuan per response</strong>. Additional nodes beyond this cap incur no extra fees. Service fees based on participant numbers are not capped.</p><p>Q: How are recruitment fees calculated for variable compensation? A: Fees are based on <strong>actual compensation paid</strong>, with unused service fees returned to account balance.</p><p>Q: What happens to prepaid fees if a project ends early? A: Unused fees are returned to your NaoDao account balance along with participant compensation.</p><p>Q: How are fees handled for special cases? A: For team accounts and project groups, each internal project is charged like standard platform publication projects. Team account sub-accounts follow main account pricing, and vouchers can be used by sub-accounts.</p><h1 id="naodao-premium-membership-introduction" tabindex="-1">NaoDao Premium Membership Introduction <a class="header-anchor" href="#naodao-premium-membership-introduction" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;NaoDao Premium Membership Introduction&quot;">​</a></h1><p>Purchase NaoDao membership through the <strong>Researcher Personal Center</strong> or visit <a href="https://research.naodao.com/vip" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">https://research.naodao.com/vip</a>.
