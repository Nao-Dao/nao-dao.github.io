## Batch Experiment Setup â€” Importing Experiment Templates

When there are many trials, setting each one manually can be time-consuming. Simple Cloud provides a quick way to set up multiple trials:
(1) First click [Download Template]
(2) After setting parameters in the template, click [Batch Import] to generate the experiment.

The downloaded template is named: `exp_template.xls`

Each column in the spreadsheet has detailed explanatory notes.

The only point that needs explanation here is regarding the URL addresses for images, videos, and audio.

As shown in column C above, there will be a unique code for each image (or video, audio). How to obtain this unique code? The method is simple, as shown below:
