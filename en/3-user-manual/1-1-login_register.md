## Registration

When first entering NaoDao, you can click the registration button in the top right corner of the homepage to enter the registration page.

New users are automatically registered as testers. To become a researcher, you need to apply for additional certification.

Testers can only complete tasks and earn compensation on NaoDao, but cannot publish their own projects. Researchers have both tester privileges (completing tasks and earning compensation) and can also publish their own experimental tasks and collect data on NaoDao.

### Registration Steps

Before registering, you'll need a Chinese phone number.

1. Enter your phone number and click "Get Verification Code"
2. Enter the verification code you received in the "Verification Code" field
3. Enter your desired password in the "Password" field. We recommend using a unique password, which will not be stored in plain text. The password must follow these rules:
   1. No Chinese characters or spaces allowed
   2. Length must be 6-16 characters
   3. Must contain at least 2 types of characters from: letters, numbers, and symbols

After completing these steps, you'll need to read the "Privacy Policy" and "User Service Agreement" at the bottom. Click on them to open in separate pages. After reading, close the popup pages. If you accept the "Privacy Policy" and "User Service Agreement", manually check "I Acknowledge" and click "Register Now". At this point, you've successfully created your account on the NaoDao platform.

## Login
