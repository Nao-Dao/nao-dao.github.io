:::tip NaoDao Tip
Is there any risk in binding Alipay and WeChat?
:::

>
> Short answer: No risk.
>
> Explanation: WeChat and Alipay do not provide open APIs to access users' sensitive information, including Alipay account numbers, real names, bank card information, etc. Therefore, NaoDao not only doesn't collect this user information but is unable to collect it. NaoDao only collects users' WeChat and Alipay nicknames and profile pictures.

## Account Information
You can view your account balance and withdrawal methods in the "Account Information" section. The minimum withdrawal amount on NaoDao is 10 yuan, with a maximum single withdrawal of 500 yuan. Note that you must complete real-name verification before making withdrawals.

> [NaoDao Tip] NaoDao currently only supports withdrawals to Alipay, not WeChat.
