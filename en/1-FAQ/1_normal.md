## Q: What is online psychological research?  
A: Broadly speaking, online psychological research refers to psychological research conducted via the internet. More specifically, on NaoDao, online psychological research refers to psychological or related scientific research conducted using **online questionnaires** and **online experiments** to recruit participants through internet subject pools and collect data.

## Q: Compared to traditional psychological research, what are the advantages of online psychological research?  
A: Online psychological research not only enables specific study of people's psychological states in internet environments but also helps reduce time, money, and human resource costs, reduces experimenter bias, and increases sample size and representativeness (thereby increasing statistical power and making significance easier to achieve).

## Q: Can online research completely replace offline research?  
A: This needs to be discussed case by case. Online questionnaires replacing offline paper-and-pencil tests is quite mature and widely accepted. However, for more complex online experiments, suitability must be judged based on research purposes and experimental requirements. Overall, online experiments cannot completely replace laboratory experiments. Researchers should choose appropriate research methods based on actual circumstances.

## Q: What kinds of experiments are not suitable for online conduct?  
A: Experiments should not or cannot be conducted online if they require precise control, specific equipment or non-audiovisual stimuli (like tactile), physiological data recording (like EEG, MRI), or if the experimental procedures/stimuli involve confidentiality.

## Q: What are the considerations for online experiments?  
A: Since experimenters are usually not present with participants during online experiments, some additional practices compared to offline experiments are needed, including but not limited to:
    - Must conduct complete testing to ensure the program given to participants can be completed normally
    - Verify participant identity validity and independence before formal experiments to avoid losses due to fraud or malicious repeated responses
    - Use stronger controls in the program, including limiting participant devices, providing more operational instructions, preparing practice phases and judging practice phase accuracy
    - Consider device differences, can use relative indicators and stimulus correction to offset variations from device differences
    - Have participants report their environment when responding

## Q: Do I need programming basics before using online experiments?  
A: Not necessarily. NaoDao provides three ways to write experiments:
    - Simple Cloud requires no programming
    - PsychoPy needs programming for some advanced controls
    - jsPsych currently only supports pure programming

Generally, online experiments have similar programming difficulty to offline experiments but use different programming languages. You can make your choice based on your experimental needs.

# NaoDao Platform Overview

## Q: How should I cite NaoDao when using the research platform?  
A: We encourage NaoDao users to cite us in related work. NaoDao's current citable literature is:
> Chen, G., Gao, X., Yan, X., Du, M., Zang, Y., & Wang, Y. (2022). *Online research in psychology: The past, present and future*. ChinaXiv. http://chinaxiv.org/abs/202206.00150

## Q: What are the advantages of the NaoDao platform for online research?  
A: As a researcher, you can experience the convenience and efficiency brought by NaoDao's resource integration model in multiple aspects including research design, data collection, quality control, dissemination and transformation of research results, teaching and science popularization. Additionally, psychology or related major students can use it for teaching tasks or research training.

## Q: What is the process for conducting online research on the NaoDao platform?  
A: After registering as a NaoDao user, if you want to conduct research rather than respond, you need to enter the researcher platform from the navigation bar. After being certified as a researcher, you can use researchers' core function - projects to advance research. Generally need to go through these steps:
    - Edit experiments, questionnaires and other content in projects
    - Publish projects
    - Wait for participant responses and pay compensation, payment channels will vary based on publication choices
    - Complete or actively cancel projects

## Q: How long does it take to get researcher certification approved?  
A: The platform currently supports 2 certification methods:
    - Certification using educational email, passes certification after entering correct verification code
    - Upload materials certification, this channel is manually reviewed, slightly slower, usually results within 48 hours. Please note to upload materials that can prove researcher identity and identify personal information to avoid resubmission and waiting due to failed review

## Q: What are the publication methods for NaoDao platform projects?  
A: NaoDao provides 2 publication methods:
    - Publish using "NaoDao Platform", project will display on NaoDao website, can use NaoDao's subject pool, collect data through NaoDao, pay participant fees, further track participants, etc.
    - Publish using "Anonymous Response", researchers need to find participants and distribute projects themselves, NaoDao only collects and stores data. Suitable for collecting data from participants who cannot or do not want to register with NaoDao

## Q: Will the NaoDao platform use my data?  
A: The right to use data collected by your account belongs to you. We will protect your data following relevant laws and regulations and will not use your collected data without permission. You can check the platform's "User Agreement" and "Privacy Policy" for user data usage.

## Q: Can participants respond using phones?  
A: We support opening and responding to adapted projects through mobile devices. However, note that the actual content participants respond to (especially experimental types) is basically provided by researchers, whether participants can effectively respond to experiments on mobile depends entirely on experiment writing, and most experiments are not suitable for mobile response, please **test in advance**.

## Q: What experimental designs can NaoDao platform functions support?  
A: Currently NaoDao can help researchers implement:
  - [x] Within-subjects, between-subjects designs
  - [x] Specified participant group participation
  - [x] Long-term participant tracking
  - [ ] Multi-person experiments (in development)

## Q: Does the NaoDao platform support access and data collection from outside mainland China?  
A: NaoDao mainly faces domestic researchers and participant groups, and uses domestic Alibaba Cloud servers. We make no guarantees about stability of overseas access. If you have such needs, please test in advance.

## Q: I need help, what support systems does NaoDao provide?  
A: For experimental writing nodes and other usage questions, we have specially configured relevant sections in the forum, currently each section is maintained by the node's main creator or research personnel who can skillfully use it; we highly welcome you to post questions after reading the corresponding posting format and specifications. We most recommend posting on the forum, but we also provide other one-on-one channels, including leaving messages on the "NaoDao Research Platform" public account, WeChat customer service, sending emails to research@naodao.com, etc.
