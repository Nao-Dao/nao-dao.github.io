Researchers can check their current account balance and perform recharge operations in their personal center - [Account Balance](https://research.naodao.com/user/acount). The balance is currently only used for participant compensation. Account balance is divided into personal accounts and corporate accounts, and the balances of these 2 accounts cannot be mixed.

### Personal Account Recharge

### Corporate Account Recharge
Corporate recharge is suitable for large-amount recharges by organizations like research groups, specifically for transfers from **<font style="color:#F38F39;">corporate bank accounts</font>** that require paper documentation for reimbursement. Corporate account recharge **<font style="color:#F38F39;">does not support direct refund operations</font>**. For refunds, please contact recharge customer service via email at [mkt@naodao.com](mailto:mkt@naodao.com).

Corporate account recharge does not support transfers from personal bank accounts. Recharge applications using personal accounts will be rejected.

Corporate recharge involves the following 5 steps:

1. **recharging party** submits a recharge application with account and contact information, awaiting platform review
2. **platform** contacts you to verify recharge information and approves the application after successful communication
3. **recharging party** transfers money to the designated platform account and confirms online (upload bank transfer receipt)
4. **platform** verifies receipt of payment, approves after financial confirmation
5. recharged amount enters the researcher's "Personal Center - Account Information - Corporate Account"

## Reimbursement Matters
### Invoice Issuance for Recharged Balance
1. **Personal Account**

In the researcher's personal center - [Issue Invoice](https://research.naodao.com/user/invoice), researchers can choose to issue electronic invoices (regular invoices) for successful recharge orders. If refunding after invoice issuance, corresponding tax amounts will be deducted.

> <font style="color:rgb(32, 31, 30);">Invoice amounts are based on recharge orders, regardless of balance usage. The system calculates available invoice balance based on recharge records, previous invoice records, and refund records.</font>

2. **Corporate Account**

For corporate accounts, invoice choice is made during recharge. After completing the recharge process, financial customer service handles invoice issuance.

### Invoice Issuance for Membership Purchase
Invoice issuance for membership purchases varies by payment method:

1. **Membership paid with corporate account balance**  
If the corporate account recharge was already invoiced, membership fees are included and cannot be invoiced again.
2. **Membership paid via third-party payment (WeChat Pay, Alipay, etc.)**  
Membership amount is added to "Available Invoice Balance". Invoice amount can be any value not exceeding "Available Invoice Balance". **For membership-specific reimbursement, issue an invoice equal to the membership fee.**
