# End Node <!-- {docsify-ignore-all} -->
The **End** node requires no configuration itself, but it serves as a marker indicating the completion of an experimental branch.

For any branch on the **canvas**, it must have both **Start** and **End** nodes. If a project branch lacks an **End** node, the canvas will determine that the project contains incomplete branches, preventing **publication**.

For project structures with **multiple branches** (meaning projects that use **random grouping or behavioral grouping nodes** to create multiple possible pathways), each branch needs its own **End** node. As shown in the image below, the project has two branches, therefore requiring two **End** nodes.
