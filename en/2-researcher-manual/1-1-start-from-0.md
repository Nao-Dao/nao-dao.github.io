## Creating a Project from Scratch <!-- {docsify-ignore-all} -->

Follow these steps to create a new project, arrange your research in the project, and "publish" it to collect data.

### Create a New "Project"
Each project can only contain one research flow, corresponding to one response session from a participant (tester). Create a new project for each different research flow!

### Edit Project Content
After creating a project, you need to arrange the research flow into canvas and nodes. Each type of node carries corresponding functions or content, such as **experiments**, **questionnaires**, etc.; while the canvas is used to arrange and organize nodes. By connecting various nodes on the canvas, researchers can achieve flexible arrangement of research content.

### Project Publication
Projects with completed content can proceed to [Project Publication](/2-researcher-manual/1-1-6-publish-project.md). Publication is the action of distributing the project to participants (testers) for responses. After publication, the project begins collecting data.

Naodao provides 2 publishing channels: **Platform Publication** and **Anonymous Publication**.

+ Platform publication puts your project on Naodao's homepage (https://www.naodao.com). Researchers distribute participant payments through Naodao and can use features like [Participant Pool](/2-researcher-manual/2-participants.md) for more precise selection of target populations
+ Anonymous publication provides only an anonymous link, and researchers need to distribute the link to participants themselves. Naodao platform does not participate in distribution, information collection, or test fee settlement for anonymously published projects

Regardless of which publishing channel is chosen, data generated from participant project completion will be **uploaded and stored on Naodao**.
