# PsychoPy Experiemnt <!-- {docsify-ignore-all} -->
PsychoPy is a popular tool for creating psychological behavioral experiments. Naodao provides support for online experiments generated by PsychoPy [**2021.2.3**](https://github.com/psychopy/psychopy/releases/tag/2021.2.3) and [**2020.1.3**](https://github.com/psychopy/psychopy/releases/tag/2020.1.3). Important note: Only experiments **written using the Builder** in PsychoPy can be automatically converted to online experiments. Python (local) experiments written using the Coder cannot be converted to online experiments.

## <font style="color:rgb(51, 51, 51);">Number of Times Each Subject Can Open the Experiment Program</font>

You can set the current experiment's name and specify the **number of times each subject is allowed to open the experiment program**. This limit refers to how many times a subject can open the experiment within a single project attempt. **It only functions as a frequency limit within one project response** and is <font style="color:rgb(51, 51, 51);">different</font> from the project-level control ["Allow users to repeat responses"](/2-researcher-manual/1-1-6-publish-project.md#作答设置).

<font style="color:rgb(38, 38, 38);"></font>

<font style="color:rgb(38, 38, 38);">For example, if we want subjects to only open the experiment once during one response session, set the number</font> to `1`；However, if you have enabled subjects to repeatedly participate in the current research project in your project publication settings, subjects can still open this experiment after abandoning their response and re-entering the project.

## Uploading Experiment Package

You can click the [Upload] button to upload psychological experiments written using **PsychoPy** software.

> Tips
>
> 1. Please make sure to convert all Python experiments to appropriate online experiments in PsychoPy Builder by selecting `File` - `Export to HTML` to export HTML files before uploading the compressed package
> 2. Files (folders) in the uploaded package with names containing Chinese or other non-ASCII characters may cause execution errors
> 3. Please ensure the uploaded package is less than 100 MB and doesn't contain a very large number of subdirectories or files. Try to avoid including multiple HTML files

### Experiment Preview
After the experiment is uploaded, a [Preview] button will appear on the right side of the **Experiment URL**. You can click this button to preview the uploaded experiment.

When the preview ends, the browser will download the data file generated from this preview for inspection.

## Experiment Scoring
Main entry: [Behavior Grouping](/2-researcher-manual/1-1-2-8-behavior-grouping.md)

After uploading the experiment package, users can **optionally** upload code to parse the CSV data files generated by the experiment to obtain a numerical result. This result can be used in subsequent behavior grouping nodes.

![①, ②, and ③ need to be uploaded in sequence. The checkbox for the next one will appear after uploading the previous one](../images/2022/1656158078427-75dc81dc-f6ef-4098-9ba1-cdc61684d470.png)
