# Certified Researchers
After registering on NaoDao and verifying their identity, researchers are initially set as NaoDao test subjects (participants). To access researcher functions, certification is required.

## Certification Methods
In addition to email verification, NaoDao requires researchers to provide proof of identity. We accept 2 methods of verification:

+ **Educational Email Certification**: Supports certification using mainland Chinese educational email domains including `edu.cn`, `edu.com`, `ac.cn`. Other email addresses will need to use document verification.
+ **Document Verification**: After filling in a non-educational email, you need to upload identity verification materials from an accredited university or research institute, such as student ID, work ID, or academic credentials. Materials are manually reviewed, typically within 2 working days.

The certification method cannot be modified once selected. Changing your email will require re-certification as a researcher.

If you don't receive the verification code email:

1. Please check your "Spam" folder. Note the verification code's expiration time.
2. Some university email systems and foreign email services may experience delays or delivery issues. If waiting and resending don't work, please try a different email or switch to document verification.

## Data Quality
The quality of online experiments has been validated by numerous studies, most concluding that online behavioral experiment data adequately meets research needs. To verify the reliability of experiments hosted on the NaoDao platform, we completed a comparative study involving 3 experiments. In this study, we tested the same experimental paradigm across three channels: **NaoDao platform**, PsychoPy's official platform **Pavlovia**, and **offline**. Results showed good effects across all three channels, with no significant differences in data quality between NaoDao and the other two channels.

# NaoDao Service Fees
## Fee Structure
Service fees are calculated using the following formula:

Project Fee = Project Hosting Fee + Recruitment Service Fee

1. **Project Hosting Fee**: A fixed fee charged for each approved response using NaoDao projects, dependent on the nodes used. For example, if using `n` paid nodes at `m` yuan per node, the hosting fee is `m×n` yuan per participant.
2. **Recruitment Service Fee**: A percentage-based fee charged on participant compensation when recruiting through the NaoDao platform. No fee is charged for anonymous submissions. For example, if paying participants `F` yuan through NaoDao with a rate of `a%`, the recruitment service fee is `F×a%` per participant.

The total project cost depends on the number of nodes, number of recruited participants, and participant compensation (if recruiting through the platform).

After considering costs, comparing similar domestic and international services, and surveying researchers, NaoDao has established the following pricing plan:

| Feature | Platform Publication<br/>(NaoDao Recruitment) | Anonymous Publication<br/>(Self-Recruitment) |
|---------|:-------------------------------------------:|:------------------------------------------:|
| Per Questionnaire Node<br/>(including personal info, test environment nodes) | Free | Free |
| Per Experiment Node<br/>(Simple Cloud, PsychoPy, jsPsych nodes) | 0.5 yuan per response | 1.0 yuan per response |
| Per Special Type Node<br/>(currently RSA nodes) | 0.8 yuan per response | 1.5 yuan per response |
| Recruitment Service Fee | 10% of actual participant compensation | None |

The **Project Hosting** fee has a **cap of 10 yuan** per response. Nodes not listed above are free. Actual charges are calculated on the project publication page.

## Frequently Asked Questions

Q: When does the new fee structure take effect?
A: The new fee structure takes effect on January 15, 2024.

Q: Will projects created before this policy affect?
A: Projects published before January 15 will not be affected. Projects created but not published before January 15 will be subject to fees if published after January 15.

Q: How are service fees paid?
A: Generally paid through NaoDao account balance. Fees are prepaid along with participant compensation at project publication and settled at project completion, with any remaining balance returned.

Q: Do member benefits include fee discounts?
A: Yes, members receive **vouchers** for fee discounts. Entry-level membership includes average monthly vouchers worth 20 yuan, professional membership includes average monthly vouchers worth 200 yuan, both close to regular membership prices.

Q: Is free anonymous publication still available for testing?
A: We've introduced a new "**Pre-publication**" feature for testing, along with the existing preview function, better suited for testing project functionality.

Q: Are fees charged for incomplete or unapproved data?
A: **Fees are only charged for valid responses**. For _platform publication_, only **approved responses** (where participants received compensation) incur fees. For _anonymous publication_, **all completed responses** are considered valid.

Q: Are fees charged for approved appeals?
A: Yes, handling participant appeals includes service fees, settled along with appeal compensation from account balance.

Q: Are duplicate nodes charged separately?
A: Nodes created through the copy function **are not charged repeatedly**. Modified nodes are treated as new and charged accordingly.

Q: Is there a cap for projects with many nodes?
A: Project hosting fees are capped at **10 yuan per response**. Additional nodes beyond this cap incur no extra fees. Service fees based on participant numbers are not capped.

Q: How are recruitment fees calculated for variable compensation?
A: Fees are based on **actual compensation paid**, with unused service fees returned to account balance.

Q: What happens to prepaid fees if a project ends early?
A: Unused fees are returned to your NaoDao account balance along with participant compensation.

Q: How are fees handled for special cases?
A: For team accounts and project groups, each internal project is charged like standard platform publication projects. Team account sub-accounts follow main account pricing, and vouchers can be used by sub-accounts.
