# Common Issues in Project Participation

## Q: What is the process for participants responding to Naodao projects?
A: Users unfamiliar with Naodao often mistake one part of a "project" for the entire project. In reality, Naodao's "project" flow is more complex and should be distinguished from individual "experiments." Experiments are parts of projects, existing as "nodes."

Understanding the project flow is important for both researchers and participants. Researchers should first ensure they're familiar with the process (having completed a full response after publishing or pre-publishing), then guide participants through the process to avoid situations where participants complete work but don't receive compensation. Below is a simple flowchart of the project process. Participants can receive compensation only after completing responses.

## Q: Participants report completing the experiment, but downloaded records show "In Progress" or "Abandoned"?
A: Most likely the participant didn't perform the final submission. Refer to the project response process explanation above.

## Q: When participants encounter issues during response, how should I troubleshoot the cause?
A: Implementing online experiments requires certain knowledge and skills, and researchers unfamiliar with this easily make mistakes. Therefore, Naodao's primary recommendation is to conduct pilot experiments or thorough testing before formal data collection (sometimes preview alone isn't sufficient, as preview and actual response conditions still differ).

> When encountering any issues during response, first consider whether the issue is widespread.
- If some people can successfully complete it, observe differences in environments (browser, operating system, etc.) between those who can and cannot complete it, and achieve optimal compatibility through device restriction features. If issues are sporadic with no clear pattern, consider network issues.
- If no one can complete it, it's likely a systematic issue, possibly due to experimental program writing errors, canvas flow setting errors, platform malfunction, etc.
If you determine there's a platform malfunction, please promptly contact platform staff through website customer service.
