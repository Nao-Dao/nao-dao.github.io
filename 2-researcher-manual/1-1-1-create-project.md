# Creating New Projects <!-- {docsify-ignore-all} -->
You can create a new research project by clicking the "Create Project" button in the top left corner of the page.

## Initial Project Setup
When creating a new project, you'll need to fill in some project information in the "Create Project" dialog box, including publishing platform, project name, participant count, node arrangement style, and project description. Note that the **publishing platform (distribution channel)** and **participant count** can usually be **modified** when publishing the project.

The purpose of filling in this information is to initialize the project. You can later modify these settings by double-clicking the start node or clicking on project information.

## Publishing Platform
Main entry: [Publishing Projects - Distribution Channels](/2-researcher-manual/1-1-6-publish-project.md#distribution-channels)

Choose the platform (channel) for publishing your project, with options for "NaoDao Platform" and "Anonymous Response."

+ **"NaoDao Platform"** publishing will list your project in the **"Answer Questions for Money"** section on the NaoDao homepage (https://www.naodao.com), targeting registered NaoDao users. Researchers distribute participant compensation through NaoDao and can use features like the [Participant Pool](/2-researcher-manual/2-participants.md) for more precise demographic targeting. Note that **researchers cannot participate in their own published projects**
+ **Anonymous publishing** provides only an **anonymous link** which researchers must distribute to participants themselves. Participants can respond without registering on NaoDao. The platform does not handle distribution, information collection, or compensation settlement for anonymous projects

Regardless of the publishing channel, participant data will be **stored on NaoDao**. However, the two publishing types differ slightly in participant screening and data review capabilities.

## Project Name
The identifying name for your project, which must be unique. Note that the project name differs from the publishing name: the project name serves as an identifier shown in the researcher's project list, while the publishing name appears during participation and on the platform homepage.

If publishing to the NaoDao platform, you'll need to set a separate publishing name; for anonymous publishing, the project name serves as the publishing name.

> Project names should not exceed 20 characters (including both Chinese and English characters)

## Participant Count
Main entry: [Publishing Projects - Participant Count](/2-researcher-manual/1-1-6-publish-project.md#participant-count)

The target number of participants to collect, must be a positive integer. The project status changes to "Completed" when the specified number of valid responses is collected. This number affects the behavior of grouping tools (random assignment) within the project. For projects published on the NaoDao platform, this number determines the required advance compensation payment.

The participant count set during project creation can usually be modified when publishing, except when using **random assignment** nodes, which require setting the count in the canvas and cannot be changed during publication.

> You can modify the count by double-clicking the start node or clicking the "Project Information" button in the top right

## Node Arrangement Style
Choose between vertical and horizontal layouts, affecting the connection point positions of nodes on the canvas.

## Project Description
The project description appears in the response interface information, typically containing project instructions. Rich text formatting is supported.

## Modifying Information
After entering the canvas, you can edit the above information by double-clicking the start node or clicking the "Project Information" button in the top right corner.
