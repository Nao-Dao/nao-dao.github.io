## Project Overview
### Name

As you can see, this is the **project name** you set when creating the project.

### Status
| Project Status | Description |
| :---: | :--- |
| Unpublished | Projects in editing state that haven't been published yet |
| Published | Projects that have been published |
| Completed | Projects that have collected the expected data and ended |
| Cancelled | Published projects that were actively cancelled by researchers |


### Publication Type
| Publication Type | Description |
| :---: | :--- |
| Official Website | Projects published on Naodao's official paid survey version, visible to all Naodao users |
| Anonymous | Anonymous publishing, generates only anonymous links, invisible to users other than publisher |


### Anonymous Link
Only anonymously published projects generate a corresponding anonymous link. You can click the [Copy Link] button to get the project link specific to an anonymous project. You can share this link with designated participants who can start answering by opening the link in their browser.

### Number of Participants
The **number of participants** for a project refers to the total number of participants who have **ever entered the project**.

This metric uses very broad statistical criteria - any participant who clicks the **start** button for the project is considered to have participated. Therefore, as you can imagine, not all participants will complete the project and submit data normally, and not all participants who submit data normally will answer questions seriously. So a project's **number of participants** is always <font style="color:#FFA940;">greater than or equal to</font> the project's **valid count**.

### Valid Count
A project's **valid count** refers to the number of accepted data records. When a project's **valid count** equals its **total**, the system determines the project is completed.

> 【Tips】Although we hope a project's **valid count** equals its **number of participants**, meaning every participant answers seriously and their data isn't rejected by researchers, this rarely happens in practice. There will always be some participants who quit midway resulting in no data, or who don't answer seriously resulting in poor quality data. Therefore, it's very normal for a project's **number of participants** to exceed its **valid count**.

### Total
A project's **total** is the **publication quantity** you set when publishing the project

### Edit
Click the [Edit] button to enter the canvas and edit the project again. Note that projects with **Published** or **Cancelled** status cannot be edited again - you cannot make any modifications after entering the canvas for these types of projects.

### Share
Click the [Share] button to share nodes in the project to personal or platform resource libraries, as well as share with designated researchers.

> 【Tips】Project sharing currently doesn't support sharing entire projects, only nodes can be shared.
>

### Delete
Click the [Delete] button to delete a project. Projects with **Published** status cannot be deleted, and any project with even one answer record cannot be deleted.

> 【Tips】Naodao currently doesn't support **Recycle Bin** functionality, so projects cannot be recovered once deleted - please be careful!
