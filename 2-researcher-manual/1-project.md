# Projects <!-- {docsify-ignore-all} -->

On the Naodao platform, researchers' studies are carried through "projects". The specific research content, such as questionnaires and experiments, are all contained within projects. Projects are **edited** and **published** by researchers, while participants **answer** them and **receive compensation**.

Users can click the [Projects] button in the navigation bar to enter the projects section.
